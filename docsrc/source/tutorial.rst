Getting started with pyexlatex
**********************************

Install
=======

To use ``pyexlatex``, you must have a LaTeX distribution installed
that includes ``lualatex``. For Linux and Windows, `TexLive <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>`_
has been tested and works well. For Mac, `MacTeX <https://tug.org/mactex/>`_ is known
to work well.

Then you also need to install the ``pyexlatex`` Python package:

    pip install pyexlatex
